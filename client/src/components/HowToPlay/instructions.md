Welcome to Skribbl.ai: Humans vs AI! Get ready for an exciting Pictionary game where humans compete against an AI in a race to guess drawings. If you've played Pictionary before, these instructions will be mostly familiar.

## Objective

    1. You are part of Team Humans, competing against the AI.
    2. Each round, one human will be given or phrase to draw.
    3. If the AI guesses the word before the humans do, they lose!

The main objective for the humans will be to draw the word/phrase in a clever way such that the humans can guess the word but the AI cannot!

To learn more about the AI, see the "Info" Page from the home screen.

The list of words/phrases can be found here: [categories.txt](/categories.txt)

## How to Play

### Creating a room

Skribbl.ai needs at least 2 players to play. To start, have one of the players create a room with the "Create Room" button. The person creating the room can choose the AI model they would like to play against and the difficulty (see the "Info" Page for more details).

### Joining a room

Once a room has been created, the other players can join using the "Join Room" button with the room code displayed at the top left of the room screen.

### Starting a game

The owner of the room (initially the person who created the room) can start the game by pressing the start button at the top right-corner of the room. If the owner leaves the game, the new owner is the person who joined the room the earliest out of the remaining players.

### Guessing words

To guess a word, you can type the guess (case-insensitive) into the chat box on the right. If the guess is correct, you will see a message saying so and the next person will get a chance to draw. If the AI guesses the correct word, you will see a message saying so and the turn will go to the next person as well.

### Skipping Words

If you do not want to draw a word (i.e. you do not understand what it means, or it is too hard), there is a button to skip to the next word. It will remain your turn.
